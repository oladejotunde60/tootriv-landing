## About Section

```
TooTriv Financial Services is a digital lending platform providing fast, affordable, and collateral-free salary-backed loans to Nigerian salaried employees.

We're solving a real problem: millions of workers in Nigeria live paycheck to paycheck. When emergencies strike — medical bills, school fees, family needs — they're forced to turn to predatory lenders charging 15-30% monthly interest, or slow bank processes that take weeks.

TooTriv changes this.

🚀 What We Offer:
• Salary advances up to ₦100,000 disbursed in under 5 minutes
• Interest rates of 7-10% per month — significantly below market average
• Multi-channel access: USSD (no internet needed), Web App, and Mobile App
• AI-powered credit scoring using salary history, BVN verification, and employer data
• Automatic repayment via salary deduction — no manual payments

🏗️ How We're Built:
• Cloud-native microservices architecture on Azure (AKS, SQL, Redis, Service Bus)
• Spring Boot (Java 17) backend with Apache Fineract core banking engine
• React + TypeScript frontend with GitOps/ArgoCD deployment
• Integrated with Paystack, Remita, and Africa's Talking for payments, disbursement, and USSD

🎯 Our Mission:
To provide every Nigerian worker with instant access to fair, transparent salary advances — bridging the gap between payday and real life.

📊 Market Opportunity:
• 15M+ salaried workers in Nigeria
• 60M+ total working population
• Digital lending market growing at 20%+ CAGR
• Salary advance segment remains massively underserved

🤝 We're looking for:
• Cloud infrastructure partners (AWS/Azure startup credits)
• Strategic investors passionate about financial inclusion in Africa
• Employer partners who want to offer TooTriv as an employee benefit
• Talented engineers, designers, and fintech professionals
